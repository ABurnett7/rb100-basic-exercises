#What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have tried to answer.

a = 7

def my_value(a)
  a += 10
end

puts a

#As in exercise 2, puts a will print 7.
#Things might look different because the variable and the paramenter were given the same name, but that doesn't change how the code is executed. tou
