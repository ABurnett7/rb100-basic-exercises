=begin
What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.


def meal
  'Dinner'
  puts 'Dinner'
end

p meal
=end

=begin

It will output
Dinner
nil

Becuse the meal method is printing 'Dinner' and returning nil (which replaced the first 'Dinner' as the return)
The method will ouput 'Dinner' and the p will output nil
=end

def meal
  'Dinner'
  puts 'Dinner'
end

p meal
